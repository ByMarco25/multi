# multi
Small multi choice application i've made to learn c++
As said, a small multi choice application with 4 choices, calculator, magic 8-ball, random number guessing game, and harry potter sorting hat.
The calculator gives the choices between adition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the program keeps looping until the user either types "stop" or "end".
Magic 8-ball asks the user to make a querry, then a random number between 0-9 is chosen and spits out what the user said, and the random response.
The random number guessing game chooses a number between 0-100, then asks the user to guess, if its wrong a new number is chosen and asks the user to guess again, but if it's correct the user is congratulated and the program tells the user to press enter to exit.
The harry potter sorting hat is multiple choice, where the user is asked a question and depending on which choice the user makes, a point added to one of the 4 houses, and at the end the house with the most points is outputtet to the user.
